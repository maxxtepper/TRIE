The Main Goal:
Base = Node
Derived = TrieNode, TermNode

This is the README for TRIE
The goal is to create a graph of legal scrabble words for fast look up

class Node {
	//	Every node has its own char
	char nval;
};

class TrieNode {
	//	This has a map of children
};

class Term : Node {
	//	This has no map
};
