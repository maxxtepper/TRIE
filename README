This is a basic TRIE data structure

Right now, I am using it to load the dictionary of legal scrabble words

$ git clone https://github.com/zeisler/scrabble

I am using scrabble/db/dictionary.csv
I needed to convert it from dos to unix

Upcoming:
-Save strings in nodes
-Prefix searching
-Suffix searching
-Word jumping
