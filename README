This is a basic TRIE data structure

Right now, I am using it to load the dictionary of legal scrabble words

$ git clone https://github.com/zeisler/scrabble

I am using scrabble/db/dictionary.csv
I needed to convert it from dos to unix

GetList can only return prefix searches for the moment

Upcoming:
-Find me words with letter x in position y
	-SparseWord:
		"b b" gives bib, bob, bub
	-SparsePrefix:
		"b b" gives all the words that have "b b" as a prefix, where the space acts the same as the end of the prefix

-Create word-letter depth lists for each node (projected memory use: ~640MB)
-Suffix searching
-Word jumping
