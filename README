This is a basic TRIE data structure

Right now, I am using it to load the dictionary of legal scrabble words

$ git clone https://github.com/zeisler/scrabble

I am using scrabble/db/dictionary.csv
I needed to convert it from dos to unix

GetList can only return prefix searches for the moment

Upcoming:
-Create word-letter depth lists for each node (projected memory use: ~640MB)
-Find me words with letter x in position y
-Suffix searching
-Word jumping
