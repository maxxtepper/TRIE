This is a basic TRIE data structure

Right now, I am using it to load the dictionary of legal scrabble words

$ git clone https://github.com/zeisler/scrabble

I am using scrabble/db/dictionary.csv
I needed to convert it from dos to unix

GetList can only return prefix searches for the moment

Upcoming:
SparseEntry-
	-SparseWord has barriers on the beginning and end of the word
	-SparsePrefix has a barrier on the beginning of the word
	-SparseSuffix has a barrier on the end of the word
	-SparseEnty will have no barriers on the ends of the word

-Create word-letter depth lists for each node (projected memory use: ~640MB)
-Suffix searching
-Word jumping
